# Note that in order to read the configuration file, Redis must be
# started with the file path as first argument:
#
# ./redis-server /path/to/redis.conf

# Note on units: when memory size is needed, it is possible to specify
# it in the usual form of 1k 5GB 4M and so forth:
#
# 1k => 1000 bytes
# 1kb => 1024 bytes
# 1m => 1000000 bytes
# 1mb => 1024*1024 bytes
# 1g => 1000000000 bytes
# 1gb => 1024*1024*1024 bytes

# 单位是大小写不敏感的，所以1GB 1Gb 1gB的写法都是完全一样的。
# units are case insensitive so 1GB 1Gb 1gB are all the same.

# By default, if no "bind" configuration directive is specified, Redis listens
# for connections from all the network interfaces available on the server.
# It is possible to listen to just one or multiple selected interfaces using
# the "bind" configuration directive, followed by one or more IP addresses.
#
# Examples:
#
# bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1
# bind 127.0.0.1 ::1
#警告：如果电脑运行redis要直接暴露在互联网中，绑定所有的端口是危险的，会给
#所有人暴露实例，所以默认的会不注释下边，会前置的监听127.0.0.1这个会还地址
#（这样意味着只能接口本机访问来连接端口）
# ~~~ WARNING ~~~ If the computer running Redis is directly exposed to the
# internet, binding to all the interfaces is dangerous and will expose the
# instance to everybody on the internet. So by default we uncomment the
# following bind directive, that will force Redis to listen only into
# the IPv4 lookback interface address (this means Redis will be able to
# accept connections only from clients running into the same computer it
# is running).
#
# IF YOU ARE SURE YOU WANT YOUR INSTANCE TO LISTEN TO ALL THE INTERFACES
# JUST COMMENT THE FOLLOWING LINE.
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
bind 10.211.55.15

# Protected mode is a layer of security protection, in order to avoid that
# Redis instances left open on the internet are accessed and exploited.
#
# When protected mode is on and if:
#
# 1) The server is not binding explicitly to a set of addresses using the
#    "bind" directive.
# 2) No password is configured.
#
# The server only accepts connections from clients connecting from the
# IPv4 and IPv6 loopback addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and from Unix domain
# sockets.
#
# By default protected mode is enabled. You should disable it only if
# you are sure you want clients from other hosts to connect to Redis
# even if no authentication is configured, nor a specific set of interfaces
# are explicitly listed using the "bind" directive.

# 1) Detect dead peers.
# 2) Take the connection alive from the point of view of network
#    equipment in the middle.
#
# On Linux, the specified value (in seconds) is the period used to send ACKs.
# Note that to close the connection the double of the time is needed.

 repl-disable-tcp-nodelay no
 是否禁止复制tcp链接的tcp nodelay参数，可传递yes或者no。默认是no，即使用tcp nodelay。如果master设置了yes来禁止tcp nodelay设置，在把数据复制给slave的时候，会减少包的数量和更小的网络带宽。但是这也可能带来数据的延迟。默认我们推荐更小的延迟，但是在数据量传输很大的场景下，建议选择yes。

 复制缓冲区大小，这是一个环形复制缓冲区，用来保存最新复制的命令。这样在slave离线的时候，不需要完全复制master的数据，如果可以执行部分同步，只需要把缓冲区的部分数据复制给slave，就能恢复正常复制状态。缓冲区的大小越大，slave离线的时间可以更长，复制缓冲区只有在有slave连接的时候才分配内存。没有slave的一段时间，内存会被释放出来，默认1m。
 数小于N，mater就禁止写入。master最少得有多少个健康的slave存活才能执行写命令。这个配置虽然不能保证N个slave都一定能接收到master的写操作，但是能避免没有足够健康的slave的时候，master不能写入来避免数据丢失。设置为0是关闭该功能。min-slaves-max-lag 10延迟小于min-slaves-max-lag秒的slave才认为是健康的slave。Setting one or the other to 0 disables the feature.

# Master-Slave replication. Use slaveof to make a Redis instance a copy of
# another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.
#
# 1) Redis replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to
#    stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least
#    a given number of slaves.
# 2) Redis slaves are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the
#    master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of
#    time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next
#    sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.
# 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a
#    network partition slaves automatically try to reconnect to masters
#    and resynchronize with them.
#
# slaveof <masterip> <masterport>

# If the master is password protected (using the "requirepass" configuration
# directive below) it is possible to tell the slave to authenticate before
# starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will
# refuse the slave request.
#
# masterauth <master-password>

# When a slave loses its connection with the master, or when the replication
# is still in progress, the slave can act in two different ways:
#
# 1) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the slave will
#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the
#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.
#
# 2) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the slave will reply with
#    an error "SYNC with master in progress" to all the kind of commands
#    but to INFO and SLAVEOF.
#
slave-serve-stale-data yes

# You can configure a slave instance to accept writes or not. Writing against
# a slave instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data
# written on a slave will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but
# may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a
# misconfiguration.
#
# Since Redis 2.6 by default slaves are read-only.
#
# Note: read only slaves are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients
# on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.
# Still a read only slave exports by default all the administrative commands
# such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extent you can improve
# security of read only slaves using 'rename-command' to shadow all the
# administrative / dangerous commands.
slave-read-only yes

# Replication SYNC strategy: disk or socket.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------
# WARNING: DISKLESS REPLICATION IS EXPERIMENTAL CURRENTLY
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# New slaves and reconnecting slaves that are not able to continue the replication
# process just receiving differences, need to do what is called a "full
# synchronization". An RDB file is transmitted from the master to the slaves.
# The transmission can happen in two different ways:
#
# 1) Disk-backed: The Redis master creates a new process that writes the RDB
#                 file on disk. Later the file is transferred by the parent
#                 process to the slaves incrementally.
# 2) Diskless: The Redis master creates a new process that directly writes the
#              RDB file to slave sockets, without touching the disk at all.
#
# With disk-backed replication, while the RDB file is generated, more slaves
# can be queued and served with the RDB file as soon as the current child producing
# the RDB file finishes its work. With diskless replication instead once
# the transfer starts, new slaves arriving will be queued and a new transfer
# will start when the current one terminates.
#
# When diskless replication is used, the master waits a configurable amount of
# time (in seconds) before starting the transfer in the hope that multiple slaves
# will arrive and the transfer can be parallelized.
#
# With slow disks and fast (large bandwidth) networks, diskless replication
# works better.
repl-diskless-sync no

# When diskless replication is enabled, it is possible to configure the delay
# the server waits in order to spawn the child that transfers the RDB via socket
# to the slaves.
#
# This is important since once the transfer starts, it is not possible to serve
# new slaves arriving, that will be queued for the next RDB transfer, so the server
# waits a delay in order to let more slaves arrive.
#
# The delay is specified in seconds, and by default is 5 seconds. To disable
# it entirely just set it to 0 seconds and the transfer will start ASAP.
repl-diskless-sync-delay 5

# Slaves send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It's possible to change
# this interval with the repl_ping_slave_period option. The default value is 10
# seconds.
#
# repl-ping-slave-period 10

# The following option sets the replication timeout for:
#
# 1) Bulk transfer I/O during SYNC, from the point of view of slave.
# 2) Master timeout from the point of view of slaves (data, pings).
# 3) Slave timeout from the point of view of masters (REPLCONF ACK pings).
#
# It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value
# specified for repl-ping-slave-period otherwise a timeout will be detected
# every time there is low traffic between the master and the slave.
#
# repl-timeout 60

# Disable TCP_NODELAY on the slave socket after SYNC?
#
# If you select "yes" Redis will use a smaller number of TCP packets and
# less bandwidth to send data to slaves. But this can add a delay for
# the data to appear on the slave side, up to 40 milliseconds with
# Linux kernels using a default configuration.
#
# If you select "no" the delay for data to appear on the slave side will
# be reduced but more bandwidth will be used for replication.
#
# By default we optimize for low latency, but in very high traffic conditions
# or when the master and slaves are many hops away, turning this to "yes" may
# be a good idea.
repl-disable-tcp-nodelay no

# Set the replication backlog size. The backlog is a buffer that accumulates
# slave data when slaves are disconnected for some time, so that when a slave
# wants to reconnect again, often a full resync is not needed, but a partial
# resync is enough, just passing the portion of data the slave missed while
# disconnected.
#
# The bigger the replication backlog, the longer the time the slave can be
# disconnected and later be able to perform a partial resynchronization.
#
# The backlog is only allocated once there is at least a slave connected.
#
# repl-backlog-size 1mb

# After a master has no longer connected slaves for some time, the backlog
# will be freed. The following option configures the amount of seconds that
# need to elapse, starting from the time the last slave disconnected, for
# the backlog buffer to be freed.
#
# A value of 0 means to never release the backlog.
#
# repl-backlog-ttl 3600

# The slave priority is an integer number published by Redis in the INFO output.
# It is used by Redis Sentinel in order to select a slave to promote into a
# master if the master is no longer working correctly.
#
# A slave with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so
# for instance if there are three slaves with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel will
# pick the one with priority 10, that is the lowest.
#
# However a special priority of 0 marks the slave as not able to perform the
# role of master, so a slave with priority of 0 will never be selected by
# Redis Sentinel for promotion.
#
# By default the priority is 100.
slave-priority 100

# It is possible for a master to stop accepting writes if there are less than
# N slaves connected, having a lag less or equal than M seconds.
#
# The N slaves need to be in "online" state.
#
# The lag in seconds, that must be <= the specified value, is calculated from
# the last ping received from the slave, that is usually sent every second.
#
# This option does not GUARANTEE that N replicas will accept the write, but
# will limit the window of exposure for lost writes in case not enough slaves
# are available, to the specified number of seconds.
#
# For example to require at least 3 slaves with a lag <= 10 seconds use:
#
# min-slaves-to-write 3
# min-slaves-max-lag 10
#
# Setting one or the other to 0 disables the feature.
#
# By default min-slaves-to-write is set to 0 (feature disabled) and
# min-slaves-max-lag is set to 10.

# A Redis master is able to list the address and port of the attached
# slaves in different ways. For example the "INFO replication" section
# offers this information, which is used, among other tools, by
# Redis Sentinel in order to discover slave instances.
# Another place where this info is available is in the output of the
# "ROLE" command of a masteer.
#
# The listed IP and address normally reported by a slave is obtained
# in the following way:
#
#   IP: The address is auto detected by checking the peer address
#   of the socket used by the slave to connect with the master.
#
#   Port: The port is communicated by the slave during the replication
#   handshake, and is normally the port that the slave is using to
#   list for connections.
#
# However when port forwarding or Network Address Translation (NAT) is
# used, the slave may be actually reachable via different IP and port
# pairs. The following two options can be used by a slave in order to
# report to its master a specific set of IP and port, so that both INFO
# and ROLE will report those values.
#
# There is no need to use both the options if you need to override just
# the port or the IP address.

# Command renaming.
#
# It is possible to change the name of dangerous commands in a shared
# environment. For instance the CONFIG command may be renamed into something
# hard to guess so that it will still be available for internal-use tools
# but not available for general clients.
#
# Example:
#
# rename-command CONFIG b840fc02d524045429941cc15f59e41cb7be6c52
#
# It is also possible to completely kill a command by renaming it into
# an empty string:
#
# rename-command CONFIG ""
#
# Please note that changing the name of commands that are logged into the
# AOF file or transmitted to slaves may cause problems.

属性说明maxclients 10000设置能连上redis的最大客户端连接数量。默认是10000个客户端连接。由于redis不区分连接是客户端连接还是内部打开文件或者和slave连接等，所以maxclients最小建议设置到32。如果超过了maxclients，redis会给新的连接发送’max number of clients reached’，并关闭连接。maxmemory <bytes>redis配置的最大内存容量。当内存满了，需要配合maxmemory-policy策略进行处理。注意slave的输出缓冲区是不计算在maxmemory内的。所以为了防止主机内存使用完，建议设置的maxmemory需要更小一些。maxmemory-policy noeviction#内存容量超过maxmemory后的处理策略。
 #volatile-lru：利用LRU算法移除设置过过期时间的key。
 #volatile-random：随机移除设置过过期时间的key。
 #volatile-ttl：移除即将过期的key，根据最近过期时间来删除（辅以TTL）
 #allkeys-lru：利用LRU算法移除任何key。
 #allkeys-random：随机移除任何key。
 #noeviction：不移除任何key，只是返回一个写错误。
 #上面的这些驱逐策略，如果redis没有合适的key驱逐，对于写命令，还是会返回错误。redis将不再接收写请求，只接收get请求。写命令包括：set setnx setex append incr decr rpush lpush rpushx lpushx linsert lset rpoplpush sadd sinter sinterstore sunion sunionstore sdiff sdiffstore zadd zincrby zunionstore zinterstore hset hsetnx hmset hincrby incrby decrby getset mset msetnx exec sort。maxmemory-samples 5lru检测的样本数。使用lru或者ttl淘汰算法，从需要淘汰的列表中随机选择sample个key，选出闲置时间最长的key移除。

# Set the max number of connected clients at the same time. By default
# this limit is set to 10000 clients, however if the Redis server is not
# able to configure the process file limit to allow for the specified limit
# the max number of allowed clients is set to the current file limit
# minus 32 (as Redis reserves a few file descriptors for internal uses).
#
# Once the limit is reached Redis will close all the new connections sending
# an error 'max number of clients reached'.
#
# maxclients 10000

# Don't use more memory than the specified amount of bytes.
# When the memory limit is reached Redis will try to remove keys
# according to the eviction policy selected (see maxmemory-policy).
#
# If Redis can't remove keys according to the policy, or if the policy is
# set to 'noeviction', Redis will start to reply with errors to commands
# that would use more memory, like SET, LPUSH, and so on, and will continue
# to reply to read-only commands like GET.
#
# This option is usually useful when using Redis as an LRU cache, or to set
# a hard memory limit for an instance (using the 'noeviction' policy).
#
# WARNING: If you have slaves attached to an instance with maxmemory on,
# the size of the output buffers needed to feed the slaves are subtracted
# from the used memory count, so that network problems / resyncs will
# not trigger a loop where keys are evicted, and in turn the output
# buffer of slaves is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion
# of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.
#
# In short... if you have slaves attached it is suggested that you set a lower
# limit for maxmemory so that there is some free RAM on the system for slave
# output buffers (but this is not needed if the policy is 'noeviction').
#
# maxmemory <bytes>

# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory
# is reached. You can select among five behaviors:
#
# volatile-lru -> remove the key with an expire set using an LRU algorithm
# allkeys-lru -> remove any key according to the LRU algorithm
# volatile-random -> remove a random key with an expire set
# allkeys-random -> remove a random key, any key
# volatile-ttl -> remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)
# noeviction -> don't expire at all, just return an error on write operations
#
# Note: with any of the above policies, Redis will return an error on write
#       operations, when there are no suitable keys for eviction.
#
#       At the date of writing these commands are: set setnx setex append
#       incr decr rpush lpush rpushx lpushx linsert lset rpoplpush sadd
#       sinter sinterstore sunion sunionstore sdiff sdiffstore zadd zincrby
#       zunionstore zinterstore hset hsetnx hmset hincrby incrby decrby
#       getset mset msetnx exec sort
#
# The default is:
#
# maxmemory-policy noeviction

# LRU and minimal TTL algorithms are not precise algorithms but approximated
# algorithms (in order to save memory), so you can tune it for speed or
# accuracy. For default Redis will check five keys and pick the one that was
# used less recently, you can change the sample size using the following
# configuration directive.
#
# The default of 5 produces good enough results. 10 Approximates very closely
# true LRU but costs a bit more CPU. 3 is very fast but not very accurate.

# maxmemory-samples 5

############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################
属性说明appendonly no默认redis使用的是rdb方式持久化，这种方式在许多应用中已经足够用了。但是redis如果中途宕机，会导致可能有几分钟的数据丢失，根据save来策略进行持久化，Append Only File是另一种持久化方式，可以提供更好的持久化特性。Redis会把每次写入的数据在接收后都写入 appendonly.aof 文件，每次启动时Redis都会先把这个文件的数据读入内存里，先忽略RDB文件。appendfilename "appendonly.aof"aof文件名appendfsync everysec#aof持久化策略的配置
 #no表示不执行fsync，由操作系统保证数据同步到磁盘，速度最快。
 #always表示每次写入都执行fsync，以保证数据同步到磁盘。
 #everysec表示每秒执行一次fsync，可能会导致丢失这1s数据。no-appendfsync-on-rewrite no在aof重写或者写入rdb文件的时候，会执行大量IO，此时对于everysec和always的aof模式来说，执行fsync会造成阻塞过长时间，no-appendfsync-on-rewrite字段设置为默认设置为no。如果对延迟要求很高的应用，这个字段可以设置为yes，否则还是设置为no，这样对持久化特性来说这是更安全的选择。设置为yes表示rewrite期间对新写操作不fsync,暂时存在内存中,等rewrite完成后再写入，默认为no，建议yes。Linux的默认fsync策略是30秒。可能丢失30秒数据。auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100aof自动重写配置。当目前aof文件大小超过上一次重写的aof文件大小的百分之多少进行重写，即当aof文件增长到一定大小的时候Redis能够调用bgrewriteaof对日志文件进行重写。当前AOF文件大小是上次日志重写得到AOF文件大小的二倍（设置为100）时，自动启动新的日志重写过程。auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb设置允许重写的最小aof文件大小，避免了达到约定百分比但尺寸仍然很小的情况还要重写aof-load-truncated yesaof文件可能在尾部是不完整的，当redis启动的时候，aof文件的数据被载入内存。重启可能发生在redis所在的主机操作系统宕机后，尤其在ext4文件系统没有加上data=ordered选项（redis宕机或者异常终止不会造成尾部不完整现象。）出现这种现象，可以选择让redis退出，或者导入尽可能多的数据。如果选择的是yes，当截断的aof文件被导入的时候，会自动发布一个log给客户端然后load。如果是no，用户必须手动redis-check-aof修复AOF文件才可以。


# By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is
# good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or
# a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on
# the configured save points).
#
# The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides
# much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy
# (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a
# dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something
# wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is
# still running correctly.
#
# AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.
# If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file
# with the better durability guarantees.
#
# Please check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.

appendonly no

# The name of the append only file (default: "appendonly.aof")

appendfilename "appendonly.aof"

# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk
# instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush
# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.
#
# Redis supports three different modes:
#
# no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.
# always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.
# everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.
#
# The default is "everysec", as that's usually the right compromise between
# speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to
# "no" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when
# it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of
# some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),
# or on the contrary, use "always" that's very slow but a bit safer than
# everysec.
#
# More details please check the following article:
# http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html
#
# If unsure, use "everysec".

# appendfsync always
appendfsync everysec
# appendfsync no

# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background
# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is
# performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations
# Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for
# this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block
# our synchronous write(2) call.
#
# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option
# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a
# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.
#
# This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is
# the same as "appendfsync none". In practical terms, this means that it is
# possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the
# default Linux settings).
#
# If you have latency problems turn this to "yes". Otherwise leave it as
# "no" that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.

no-appendfsync-on-rewrite no

# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.
# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling
# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.
#
# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the
# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of
# the AOF at startup is used).
#
# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is
# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also
# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this
# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase
# is reached but it is still pretty small.
#
# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF
# rewrite feature.

auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100
auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb

# An AOF file may be found to be truncated at the end during the Redis
# startup process, when the AOF data gets loaded back into memory.
# This may happen when the system where Redis is running
# crashes, especially when an ext4 filesystem is mounted without the
# data=ordered option (however this can't happen when Redis itself
# crashes or aborts but the operating system still works correctly).
#
# Redis can either exit with an error when this happens, or load as much
# data as possible (the default now) and start if the AOF file is found
# to be truncated at the end. The following option controls this behavior.
#
# If aof-load-truncated is set to yes, a truncated AOF file is loaded and
# the Redis server starts emitting a log to inform the user of the event.
# Otherwise if the option is set to no, the server aborts with an error
# and refuses to start. When the option is set to no, the user requires
# to fix the AOF file using the "redis-check-aof" utility before to restart
# the server.
#
# Note that if the AOF file will be found to be corrupted in the middle
# the server will still exit with an error. This option only applies when
# Redis will try to read more data from the AOF file but not enough bytes
# will be found.
aof-load-truncated yes

################################ LUA SCRIPTING  ###############################
属性说明lua-time-limit 5000如果达到最大时间限制（毫秒），redis会记个log，然后返回error。当一个脚本超过了最大时限。只有SCRIPT KILL和SHUTDOWN NOSAVE可以用。第一个可以杀没有调write命令的东西。要是已经调用了write，只能用第二个命令杀。

# Max execution time of a Lua script in milliseconds.
#
# If the maximum execution time is reached Redis will log that a script is
# still in execution after the maximum allowed time and will start to
# reply to queries with an error.
#
# When a long running script exceeds the maximum execution time only the
# SCRIPT KILL and SHUTDOWN NOSAVE commands are available. The first can be
# used to stop a script that did not yet called write commands. The second
# is the only way to shut down the server in the case a write command was
# already issued by the script but the user doesn't want to wait for the natural
# termination of the script.
#
# Set it to 0 or a negative value for unlimited execution without warnings.

################################ REDIS CLUSTER  ###############################
属性说明cluster-enabled <yes/no>该项如果设置成yes，该实例支持redis集群。否则该实例会像往常一样以独立模式启动。cluster-config-file <filename>必须注意到尽管该项是可选的，这并不是一个用户可以编辑的配置文件，这是redis集群节点自动生成的配置文件，每次一旦配置有修改它都通过该配置文件来持久化配置（基本上都是状态），这样在下次启动的时候可以重新读取这些配置。该文件中列出了该集群中的其他节点的状态，持久化变量等信息。 当节点收到一些信息的时候该文件就会被冲重写。cluster-node-timeout <milliseconds>redis集群节点的最大超时时间。响应超过这个时间的话该节点会被认为是挂掉了。如果一个master节点超过一定的时候无法访问，它会被它的slave取代。 该参数在redis集群配置中很重要。很明显，当节点无法访问大部分master节点超过一定时间后，它会停止接受查询请求。cluster-slave-validity-factor <factor>如果将该项设置为0，不管slave节点和master节点间失联多久都会一直尝试failover（设为正数，失联大于一定时间（factor*节点TimeOut），不再进行FailOver）。比如，如果节点的timeout设置为5秒，该项设置为10，如果master跟slave之间失联超过50秒，slave不会去failover它的master（意思是不会去把master设置为挂起状态，并取代它）。注意：任意非0数值都有可能导致当master挂掉又没有slave去failover它，这样redis集群不可用。在这种情况下只有原来那个master重新回到集群中才能让集群恢复工作。cluster-migration-barrier <count>一个master可以拥有的最小slave数量。该项的作用是，当一个master没有任何slave的时候，某些有富余slave的master节点，可以自动的分一个slave给它。具体参见手册中的replica migration章节cluster-require-full-coverage <yes/no>如果该项设置为yes（默认就是yes） 当一定比例的键空间没有被覆盖到（就是某一部分的哈希槽没了，有可能是暂时挂了）集群就停止处理任何查询炒作。如果该项设置为no，那么就算请求中只有一部分的键可以被查到，一样可以查询（但是有可能会查不全）

#
#正常的Redis实例不能是Redis的群集的一部分;只有那些开始作为可以在群集
# 节点的节点。为了启动一个Redis的实例作为群集节点启用群集支持取消注释如下：
# cluster-enabled yes

# Every cluster node has a cluster configuration file. This file is not
# intended to be edited by hand. It is created and updated by Redis nodes.
# Every Redis Cluster node requires a different cluster configuration file.
# Make sure that instances running in the same system do not have
# overlapping cluster configuration file names.
#
# 每个 集群节点有一个配置文件。这个配置文件不用手动修改。他的创建和修改都
#通过redis节点。每个redis 集群节点需要不同的集群配置文件。确保在运行的环境中
#没有重叠的文件名称。
# cluster-config-file nodes-6379.conf

# Cluster node timeout is the amount of milliseconds a node must be unreachable
# for it to be considered in failure state.
# Most other internal time limits are multiple of the node timeout.
#集群节点超时时间
# cluster-node-timeout 15000

# A slave of a failing master will avoid to start a failover if its data
# looks too old.
# 如果一个节点内容不是最新的话，就不会把他提升为主节点。
#
# There is no simple way for a slave to actually have a exact measure of
# its "data age", so the following two checks are performed:
#没有一个简单的办法来判断从节点的数据是不是最新的，所以有下边两种方法来检查。
#
# 1)如果有多个从节点来作为故障转移，他们互相之间交换信息来获取更多的选举优势（
#  从主节点更多的获取数据）。从节点通过他们数据的偏移量（数据信息）来排序，并且以
#  此来选举。
# 1) If there are multiple slaves able to failover, they exchange messages
#    in order to try to give an advantage to the slave with the best
#    replication offset (more data from the master processed).
#    Slaves will try to get their rank by offset, and apply to the start
#    of the failover a delay proportional to their rank.
#
# 2）每个从节点都有一个和主节点最后通信的时间。可以以最后ping主节点得到信息
#  的时间为准。或者是以最后和主节点断开连接的时间为准。如果最后的交互时间太早，
# 就不会把这个节点提升为主节点。
# 2) Every single slave computes the time of the last interaction with
#    its master. This can be the last ping or command received (if the master
#    is still in the "connected" state), or the time that elapsed since the
#    disconnection with the master (if the replication link is currently down).
#    If the last interaction is too old, the slave will not try to failover
#    at all.
#
# 上边第二点也可以进行手动切换。特别是如果从节点不做为故障转移使用，那么最后和主
# 节点的交互时间，时间大于从节点则不切换。
# The point "2" can be tuned by user. Specifically a slave will not perform
# the failover if, since the last interaction with the master, the time
# elapsed is greater than:
#
#  节点超时时间 * 从节点和主节点失联时间 + 从节点向服务器ping的间隔时间
#   (node-timeout * slave-validity-factor) + repl-ping-slave-period
#
# 例如如果节点超时时间是30S，主节点失联重试时间，从节点定时向主节点ping的时间
# 间隔为10S，那么从节点就不会进行故障转移，如果时间不超过310S的话。
# So for example if node-timeout is 30 seconds, and the slave-validity-factor
# is 10, and assuming a default repl-ping-slave-period of 10 seconds, the
# slave will not try to failover if it was not able to talk with the master
# for longer than 310 seconds.
#

#设置太长的“从节点和主节点的失联时间”可能会导致太老的从节点称为主节点，
#当“从节点和主节点的失联时间”太小，有可能导致选不出来主节点
# A large slave-validity-factor may allow slaves with too old data to failover
# a master, while a too small value may prevent the cluster from being able to
# elect a slave at all.
#

# 为了最大的可用性，可以把“从节点和主节点的失联时间”位置为0，这意味着，从节点
# 将一直尝试故障的切换，无论他们是什么时间和主节点进行通信（不过，他们总是试图以低偏移量
# 来进行排序）
# For maximum availability, it is possible to set the slave-validity-factor
# to a value of 0, which means, that slaves will always try to failover the
# master regardless of the last time they interacted with the master.
# (However they'll always try to apply a delay proportional to their
# offset rank).
#

# 0是唯一可以保证所有的分区集群可以延续
# Zero is the only value able to guarantee that when all the partitions heal
# the cluster will always be able to continue.
#
#
# 如果将该项设置为0，不管slave节点和master节点间失联多久都会一直尝试failover
# cluster-slave-validity-factor 10

# 集群节点可以故障转移到孤立的主节点，当主节点没有工作的子节点上。这提高了集群中孤立
# 子主节点的能力，否则当主节点没有可以用子节点的时候他无法工作。
# Cluster slaves are able to migrate to orphaned masters, that are masters
# that are left without working slaves. This improves the cluster ability
# to resist to failures as otherwise an orphaned master can't be failed over
# in case of failure if it has no working slaves.
#

# 只有集群中还有一定其他数量的工作子节点为旧的主节点工作，子节点才能迁移到孤立的主
# 节点上，这个数字就是故障屏蔽，如果为1那么就算只有一个子节点也能进行正常的主节点选举
# 它通常反映了你想要每个集群的数量。
# Slaves migrate to orphaned masters only if there are still at least a
# given number of other working slaves for their old master. This number
# is the "migration barrier". A migration barrier of 1 means that a slave
# will migrate only if there is at least 1 other working slave for its master
# and so forth. It usually reflects the number of slaves you want for every
# master in your cluster.
#

# 默认是1 （从节点可以进行故障转移就算他们的主节点还有一个节点）。如果要阻止迁移的话
# 只需要给这个属性设定一个非常大的值，但是这个知识在调试的时候才使用，并且这个是非常
# 危险的操作。
# Default is 1 (slaves migrate only if their masters remain with at least
# one slave). To disable migration just set it to a very large value.
# A value of 0 can be set but is useful only for debugging and dangerous
# in production.
#
# cluster-migration-barrier 1


# 默认的 Redis 集群节点会停止接受查询，如果探测到存在一定数量未被覆盖的值。
# 这种方法如果集群中部分的几点宕机了，所有的集群节点变得不可用。它会自动尽快
# 的返回结果
# By default Redis Cluster nodes stop accepting queries if they detect there
# is at least an hash slot uncovered (no available node is serving it).
# This way if the cluster is partially down (for example a range of hash slots
# are no longer covered) all the cluster becomes, eventually, unavailable.
# It automatically returns available as soon as all the slots are covered again.
#

# 然后有的时候你想要这部分集群是工作的，继续接受查询请求组，就算只有一部分是可用的
# 如果这样的话只需要把值设置为no
# However sometimes you want the subset of the cluster which is working,
# to continue to accept queries for the part of the key space that is still
# covered. In order to do so, just set the cluster-require-full-coverage
# option to no.
#
# cluster-require-full-coverage yes

# In order to setup your cluster make sure to read the documentation

################################## SLOW LOG ###################################
属性说明slowlog-log-slower-than 10000slog log是用来记录redis运行中执行比较慢的命令耗时。当命令的执行超过了指定时间，就记录在slow log中，slog log保存在内存中，所以没有IO操作。
 #执行时间比slowlog-log-slower-than大的请求记录到slowlog里面，单位是微秒，所以1000000就是1秒。注意，负数时间会禁用慢查询日志，而0则会强制记录所有命令。slowlog-max-len 128慢查询日志长度。当一个新的命令被写进日志的时候，最老的那个记录会被删掉。这个长度没有限制。只要有足够的内存就行。你可以通过 SLOWLOG RESET 来释放内存。

# The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified
# execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations
# like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,
# but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only
# stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve
# other requests in the meantime).
#
# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis
# what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the
# command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the
# slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the
# queue of logged commands.

# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent
# to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while
# a value of zero forces the logging of every command.
slowlog-log-slower-than 10000

# There is no limit to this length. Just be aware that it will consume memory.
# You can reclaim memory used by the slow log with SLOWLOG RESET.

################################ LATENCY MONITOR ##############################
属性说明latency-monitor-threshold 0延迟监控功能是用来监控redis中执行比较缓慢的一些操作，用LATENCY打印redis实例在跑命令时的耗时图表。只记录大于等于下边设置的值的操作。0的话，就是关闭监视。默认延迟监控功能是关闭的，如果你需要打开，也可以通过CONFIG SET命令动态设置。


# The Redis latency monitoring subsystem samples different operations
# at runtime in order to collect data related to possible sources of
# latency of a Redis instance.
#
# Via the LATENCY command this information is available to the user that can
# print graphs and obtain reports.
#
# The system only logs operations that were performed in a time equal or
# greater than the amount of milliseconds specified via the
# latency-monitor-threshold configuration directive. When its value is set
# to zero, the latency monitor is turned off.
#
# By default latency monitoring is disabled since it is mostly not needed
# if you don't have latency issues, and collecting data has a performance
# impact, that while very small, can be measured under big load. Latency
# monitoring can easily be enabled at runtime using the command
# "CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold <milliseconds>" if needed.

 #notify-keyspace-events 的参数可以是以下字符的任意组合，它指定了服务器该发送哪些类型的通知：
 ##K 键空间通知，所有通知以 __keyspace@__ 为前缀
 ##E 键事件通知，所有通知以 __keyevent@__ 为前缀
 ##g DEL 、 EXPIRE 、 RENAME 等类型无关的通用命令的通知
 ##$ 字符串命令的通知

 ##A 参数 g$lshzxe 的别名
 #输入的参数中至少要有一个 K 或者 E，否则的话，不管其余的参数是什么，都不会有任何 通知被分发。详细使用可以参考http://redis.io/topics/notifications


# Redis can notify Pub/Sub clients about events happening in the key space.
# This feature is documented at http://redis.io/topics/notifications
#
# For instance if keyspace events notification is enabled, and a client
# performs a DEL operation on key "foo" stored in the Database 0, two
# messages will be published via Pub/Sub:
#
# PUBLISH __keyspace@0__:foo del
# PUBLISH __keyevent@0__:del foo
#
# It is possible to select the events that Redis will notify among a set
# of classes. Every class is identified by a single character:
#
#  K     Keyspace events, published with __keyspace@<db>__ prefix.
#  E     Keyevent events, published with __keyevent@<db>__ prefix.
#  g     Generic commands (non-type specific) like DEL, EXPIRE, RENAME, ...
#  $     String commands
#  l     List commands
#  s     Set commands
#  h     Hash commands
#  z     Sorted set commands
#  x     Expired events (events generated every time a key expires)
#  e     Evicted events (events generated when a key is evicted for maxmemory)
#  A     Alias for g$lshzxe, so that the "AKE" string means all the events.
#
#  The "notify-keyspace-events" takes as argument a string that is composed
#  of zero or multiple characters. The empty string means that notifications
#  are disabled.
#
#  Example: to enable list and generic events, from the point of view of the

属性说明hash-max-ziplist-entries 512数据量小于等于hash-max-ziplist-entries的用ziplist，大于hash-max-ziplist-entries用hashhash-max-ziplist-value 64value大小小于等于hash-max-ziplist-value的用ziplist，大于hash-max-ziplist-value用hash。list-max-ziplist-entries 512数据量小于等于list-max-ziplist-entries用ziplist，大于list-max-ziplist-entries用list。list-max-ziplist-value 64value大小小于等于list-max-ziplist-value的用ziplist，大于list-max-ziplist-value用list。set-max-intset-entries 512数据量小于等于set-max-intset-entries用iniset，大于set-max-intset-entries用set。zset-max-ziplist-entries 128数据量小于等于zset-max-ziplist-entries用ziplist，大于zset-max-ziplist-entries用zset。zset-max-ziplist-value 64value大小小于等于zset-max-ziplist-value用ziplist，大于zset-max-ziplist-value用zset。hll-sparse-max-bytes 3000value大小小于等于hll-sparse-max-bytes使用稀疏数据结构（sparse），大于hll-sparse-max-bytes使用稠密的数据结构（dense）。一个比16000大的value是几乎没用的，建议的value大概为3000。如果对CPU要求不高，对空间要求较高的，建议设置到10000左右。activerehashing yesRedis将在每100毫秒时使用1毫秒的CPU时间来对redis的hash表进行重新hash，可以降低内存的使用。当你的使用场景中，有非常严格的实时性需要，不能够接受Redis时不时的对请求有2毫秒的延迟的话，把这项配置为no。如果没有这么严格的实时性要求，可以设置为yes，以便能够尽可能快的释放内存。client-output-buffer-limit normal 0 0 0对客户端输出缓冲进行限制可以强迫那些不从服务器读取数据的客户端断开连接，用来强制关闭传输缓慢的客户端。
 #对于normal client，第一个0表示取消hard limit，第二个0和第三个0表示取消soft limit，normal client默认取消限制，因为如果没有寻问，他们是不会接收数据的。client-output-buffer-limit slave 256mb 64mb 60对于slave client和MONITER client，如果client-output-buffer一旦超过256mb，又或者超过64mb持续60秒，那么服务器就会立即断开客户端连接。client-output-buffer-limit pubsub 32mb 8mb 60对于pubsub client，如果client-output-buffer一旦超过32mb，又或者超过8mb持续60秒，那么服务器就会立即断开客户端连接。hz 10redis执行任务的频率为1s除以hz。aof-rewrite-incremental-fsync yes在aof重写的时候，如果打开了aof-rewrite-incremental-fsync开关，系统会每32MB执行一次fsync。这对于把文件写入磁盘是有帮助的，可以避免过大的延迟峰值。

# Hashes are encoded using a memory efficient data structure when they have a
# small number of entries, and the biggest entry does not exceed a given
# threshold. These thresholds can be configured using the following directives.
hash-max-ziplist-entries 512
hash-max-ziplist-value 64

# Lists are also encoded in a special way to save a lot of space.
# The number of entries allowed per internal list node can be specified
# as a fixed maximum size or a maximum number of elements.
# For a fixed maximum size, use -5 through -1, meaning:
# -5: max size: 64 Kb  <-- not recommended for normal workloads
# -4: max size: 32 Kb  <-- not recommended
# -3: max size: 16 Kb  <-- probably not recommended
# -2: max size: 8 Kb   <-- good
# -1: max size: 4 Kb   <-- good
# Positive numbers mean store up to _exactly_ that number of elements
# per list node.
# The highest performing option is usually -2 (8 Kb size) or -1 (4 Kb size),
# but if your use case is unique, adjust the settings as necessary.
list-max-ziplist-size -2

# Lists may also be compressed.
# Compress depth is the number of quicklist ziplist nodes from *each* side of
# the list to *exclude* from compression.  The head and tail of the list
# are always uncompressed for fast push/pop operations.  Settings are:
# 0: disable all list compression
# 1: depth 1 means "don't start compressing until after 1 node into the list,
#    going from either the head or tail"
#    So: [head]->node->node->...->node->[tail]
#    [head], [tail] will always be uncompressed; inner nodes will compress.
# 2: [head]->[next]->node->node->...->node->[prev]->[tail]
#    2 here means: don't compress head or head->next or tail->prev or tail,
#    but compress all nodes between them.
# 3: [head]->[next]->[next]->node->node->...->node->[prev]->[prev]->[tail]
# etc.

# Sets have a special encoding in just one case: when a set is composed
# of just strings that happen to be integers in radix 10 in the range
# of 64 bit signed integers.
# The following configuration setting sets the limit in the size of the
# set in order to use this special memory saving encoding.
set-max-intset-entries 512

# Similarly to hashes and lists, sorted sets are also specially encoded in
# order to save a lot of space. This encoding is only used when the length and
# elements of a sorted set are below the following limits:
zset-max-ziplist-entries 128
zset-max-ziplist-value 64

# HyperLogLog sparse representation bytes limit. The limit includes the
# 16 bytes header. When an HyperLogLog using the sparse representation crosses
# this limit, it is converted into the dense representation.
#
# A value greater than 16000 is totally useless, since at that point the
# dense representation is more memory efficient.
#
# The suggested value is ~ 3000 in order to have the benefits of
# the space efficient encoding without slowing down too much PFADD,
# which is O(N) with the sparse encoding. The value can be raised to
# ~ 10000 when CPU is not a concern, but space is, and the data set is
# composed of many HyperLogLogs with cardinality in the 0 - 15000 range.
hll-sparse-max-bytes 3000

# Active rehashing uses 1 millisecond every 100 milliseconds of CPU time in
# order to help rehashing the main Redis hash table (the one mapping top-level
# keys to values). The hash table implementation Redis uses (see dict.c)
# performs a lazy rehashing: the more operation you run into a hash table
# that is rehashing, the more rehashing "steps" are performed, so if the
# server is idle the rehashing is never complete and some more memory is used
# by the hash table.
#
# The default is to use this millisecond 10 times every second in order to
# actively rehash the main dictionaries, freeing memory when possible.
#
# If unsure:
# use "activerehashing no" if you have hard latency requirements and it is
# not a good thing in your environment that Redis can reply from time to time
# to queries with 2 milliseconds delay.
#
# use "activerehashing yes" if you don't have such hard requirements but
# want to free memory asap when possible.
activerehashing yes

# The client output buffer limits can be used to force disconnection of clients
# that are not reading data from the server fast enough for some reason (a
# common reason is that a Pub/Sub client can't consume messages as fast as the
# publisher can produce them).
#
# The limit can be set differently for the three different classes of clients:
#
# normal -> normal clients including MONITOR clients
# slave  -> slave clients
# pubsub -> clients subscribed to at least one pubsub channel or pattern
#
# The syntax of every client-output-buffer-limit directive is the following:
#
# client-output-buffer-limit <class> <hard limit> <soft limit> <soft seconds>
#
# A client is immediately disconnected once the hard limit is reached, or if
# the soft limit is reached and remains reached for the specified number of
# seconds (continuously).
# So for instance if the hard limit is 32 megabytes and the soft limit is
# 16 megabytes / 10 seconds, the client will get disconnected immediately
# if the size of the output buffers reach 32 megabytes, but will also get
# disconnected if the client reaches 16 megabytes and continuously overcomes
# the limit for 10 seconds.
#
# By default normal clients are not limited because they don't receive data
# without asking (in a push way), but just after a request, so only
# asynchronous clients may create a scenario where data is requested faster
# than it can read.
#
# Instead there is a default limit for pubsub and slave clients, since
# subscribers and slaves receive data in a push fashion.
#
# Both the hard or the soft limit can be disabled by setting them to zero.
client-output-buffer-limit normal 0 0 0

client-output-buffer-limit pubsub 32mb 8mb 60

# Redis calls an internal function to perform many background tasks, like
# closing connections of clients in timeout, purging expired keys that are
# never requested, and so forth.
#
# Not all tasks are performed with the same frequency, but Redis checks for
# tasks to perform according to the specified "hz" value.
#
# By default "hz" is set to 10. Raising the value will use more CPU when
# Redis is idle, but at the same time will make Redis more responsive when
# there are many keys expiring at the same time, and timeouts may be
# handled with more precision.
#
# The range is between 1 and 500, however a value over 100 is usually not
# a good idea. Most users should use the default of 10 and raise this up to
# 100 only in environments where very low latency is required.
hz 10

# When a child rewrites the AOF file, if the following option is enabled
# the file will be fsync-ed every 32 MB of data generated. This is useful
# in order to commit the file to the disk more incrementally and avoid
# big latency spikes.
